/**
 * Plan A @tursodatabase/sync sidecar wedge detection and one-time repair.
 *
 * Two different "sidecar" concepts:
 * - Legacy (cutover): `_papr_sync_log`, CDC tables, legacy sync state — stripped at cutover,
 *   not recreated. Safe to delete permanently.
 * - Plan A replica (required): `data.db-info`, `data.db-changes`, `data.db-wal`, `data.db-shm`,
 *   `data.db-wal-revert` — owned by @tursodatabase/sync. The SDK recreates them on connect;
 *   do not delete them in normal operation.
 *
 * A "wedge" is when `data.db-info` carries a `revert_since_wal_watermark` that names a frame
 * the `data.db-wal` does not contain. The engine resolves that watermark through
 * `WalFile::find_frame`, which asserts the frame exists — an unsatisfiable watermark is a Rust
 * `panic!`, and a panic inside the napi worker aborts the whole process rather than surfacing a
 * catchable error. Detection is therefore a precondition check, not error handling: once pull()
 * runs it is already too late.
 *
 * Repair resets only Plan A sidecars (keeps data.db), so the next connect re-bootstraps WAL
 * state from Turso.

/**
 * After a sync-engine checkpoint/WAL error, reset Plan A sidecars (keep data.db).
 * Stronger than detect-only repair — the error itself signals metadata/WAL drift.
 *
 * The marker is written only when the file cannot be shown to hold rows, because the marker
 * is not free and the drift this repairs is in the sidecars rather than in data.db. A marker
 * forces the next `openSpec` onto the bootstrap path, which snapshots the whole file with
 * `VACUUM INTO`, re-downloads it, replays the snapshot back, and serves
 * "Replica bootstrap backoff active" to every read until that finishes — minutes of 503s on a
 * large replica whose rows were never in question.
 *
 * Skipping it leaves exactly the state {@link attachTursoReplicaInPlaceForCutover} creates
 * deliberately: sidecars gone, data.db populated, reconnect with `bootstrapIfEmpty: false`.
 * Its own contract is "attach to an existing data.db without re-downloading rows", so this is
 * a supported resting state and not a new one. The caller's immediate retry already runs that
 * way, since it reuses the spec computed before this call.
 *
 * Empty and unreadable both keep the marker. Empty is the silent-empty-replica case the marker
 * exists for: `openSpec` decides `bootstrapIfEmpty` from the file merely existing, so a
 * repaired-but-empty replica looks established and is never seeded. Unreadable is not evidence
 * of "populated" — per `countUserRows`, -1 means unknown and must never be read as empty, so
 * the conservative branch is the correct one for it too.
 *
 * Counting precedes the delete: rows that live only in `-wal` are real rows, and removing the
 * sidecar first would undercount a populated file to 0 — producing the marker this avoids.
 * Both callers close the worker handle before calling, so a -1 here means the file genuinely
 * cannot be read rather than that the engine is holding it.
