/**
 * Issue: a checkpoint/WAL error re-bootstrapped a healthy replica.
 *
 * `repairReplicaSidecarsOnCheckpointError` wrote a bootstrap-pending marker unconditionally,
 * so a Data Room holding 27k rows was snapshotted, re-downloaded and replayed because its
 * sidecars drifted — serving "Replica bootstrap backoff active" 503s throughout. These tests
 * pin the narrowing: the marker follows the rows, not the mere existence of the file.
